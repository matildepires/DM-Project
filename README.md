**Project Description:**
This project aims to produce a Customer Segmentation for the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)-
a non-profit organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord
injuries or disease.
From the 13 million donors of this association database, we were provided with information on
95412 donors, having 476 specified features about each â€“ either information about themselves, the
type of donor they are and the neighbourhood they live in or.
After cleaning and transforming the data, we resorted to different Data Mining
algorithms in order to segment those clients into 4 different groups/clusters, who reveal a similar
behaviour, so as to later define a logical marketing strategy for each.
